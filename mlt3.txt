MLT-3 (Modified Lullabye Transmission Level 3) is a line encoding technique used
in telecommunication systems to transmit digital signals over a physical medium such as a copper wire.
In MLT-3 encoding, each bit is represented by a three-level signal. The three signal levels are typically -1, 0, and +1.
The encoding logic of MLT-3 is based on the principle of reducing the number of consecutive zeros in the transmitted signal.
This is because long sequences of zeros can cause synchronization and clocking errors in the receiver.
In MLT-3, a "0" bit is represented by no change in signal level (i.e., the signal stays at its current level).
A "1" bit is represented by a transition to the next signal level. However, instead of transitioning to the highest
or lowest signal level, as in other line encoding techniques, MLT-3 transitions to the middle signal level.
For example, if the current signal level is 0 and the next bit to be transmitted is a "1", the signal level will
transition to +1. If the next bit to be transmitted is a "0", the signal level will remain at +1. If the next bit is also
a "0", the signal level will transition to 0 (i.e., the middle signal level).
The use of the middle signal level for "1" bits reduces the number of consecutive zeros in the transmitted signal,
which improves synchronization and clocking in the receiver. Additionally, MLT-3 has a lower DC (direct current) component
than other line encoding techniques, which reduces power consumption and electromagnetic interference.
However, MLT-3 encoding has a lower data rate than other techniques that use more signal levels, such as 4B/5B encoding.
